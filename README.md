#Full-Stack Signup & Login System (React, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, JWT)
#Description
A secure full-stack authentication system with a React-based frontend and FastAPI backend. Users can register with a username, email, and password; passwords are securely hashed before being stored in PostgreSQL. The backend uses JWT authentication to issue access tokens for protected routes. Features include a responsive user interface, RESTful API endpoints, and modern security practices.

#Tech Stack

#Frontend
React with HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Responsive design for multiple screen sizes

#Backend
FastAPI framework (Python)
PostgreSQL database
JWT-based authentication for secure sessions
Password hashing with bcrypt

#Features
User registration with username, email, and password
Password encryption before storage
Login authentication using JWT access tokens
Stateless and secure session handling
Protected API routes accessible only with valid tokens
Modern, responsive UI for optimal user experience

#Project Structure
Frontend: Contains React application files for the user interface
Backend: Contains FastAPI application files for API endpoints and database operations

#Setup Overview
Important: The repository does not include installed modules for the frontend or backend. You must install the required dependencies before running the project.

#Clone the repository to your local machine.

Install backend modules: Set up a Python virtual environment and install the necessary packages (FastAPI, psycopg2, bcrypt, python-jose, etc.).
Install frontend modules: Use a package manager (e.g., npm or yarn) to install React and other dependencies (axios, react-router-dom, etc.).
Configure environment variables for database connection, JWT secret, and token expiry time.
Run the backend server and start the frontend application.
Connect frontend and backend for full authentication functionality.

#Security Measures
Passwords are hashed using bcrypt before database storage
JWT tokens provide stateless, secure authentication
Sensitive configurations are stored in environment variables
